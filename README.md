- 👋 Hi, I’m @mattisvoss
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning and numerical methods, especially as applied to problems in physics and engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about physics-informed neural networks, their implementation in JAX, and by extension functional programming.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the use of PINNs for turbulence modelling.
- 📫 How to reach me: email mattis.voss@gmail.com
